  <h2> Biography and hobbies </h2>
  Hello I'm 26 years old, I teach mathematics at elementary and high school level. I really enjoy science and logic and mathematics.</br>
  last year I was teaching physics and mathematics, and I was having a blast, it was fun, but also very exausting, so this year I stick only with math.</br>
  I have one year when I studied quemistry just for the sake of it, and helped a lot of my students with termo, eletro quemistry, but I have to admit
  organic quemistry is very difficult for me, and in those days and even in these days i don't understand a bit of it.</br>
  </br>
  This year I stated to work with programation in the State of ParanÃ¡ in Brazil, I am one of the tutors of a group of studies disigned to introduce children and professor to programing languages, I am very excited!</br>
  </br>
  I am also enjoy a lot of arts, like music and painting, I am not really god at any of those, but I have tried to play saxophone, guitar, and BASS, i can play for myself and have some fun, but when i am with other people my horrible skills show up.</br>
  I woul like to start singing lessons, but I didn't get the courage yet.</br>
  And this year I bought a course in Udemy for digital painting, and I am dragging it a little bir but have already make a very beatiful eye.</br>
